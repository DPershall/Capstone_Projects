# MovieLense_Capstone_Project
This is one of my final projects for the HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate Program. As the title suggests, it is on the Group Lense database
colloquially known as Movie Lense. The goal of the project is to predict ratings with a RMSE below .86490. I was able to surpass the goal with 3 different
models. I hope you enjoy reading this project.
